# Engineering Levels at Bunch ‚òÑÔ∏èüöÄüåå

At Bunch, we like space and movies like Star Wars (especially our CEO). So instead of your regular "Junior, Senior" positions, we go for slightly more original ones. That doesn't mean we take your growth lightly, just that we like having fun üòä

## The Jedi Order

To give you some background, here's manuscript of the Jedi Order, annotated by Yoda and Anakin themselves! ü§ì

### How this fits into Bunch

We follow a similar structure to help people move up in the Jedi Order at Bunch. We want to be as transparent as possible with eveyrone, and would love to get your feedback even if you're not planning on joining us (just open a Pull Request üéÅ). You can find more details on what each of these criterias mean [below](#in-more-details).

### Recap table (TL;DR)

Because, who doesn't like tables? üòÖ

| Rank | Tech Skills (Main / Secondary) | Problem Solving | Impact & Initiatives | Ownership | Culture background | Customer focus |
|------|----------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------|--------------------|----------------|

| Padawan | [Han Solo](#han-solo-proficient) / [Young Anakin](#young-anakin-hustler) | Level 3+ | Improve the team | Involved in 2 areas | Read O'Reilly's whitepaper | Intercom rotation |
| Jedi Knight | [Luke Skywalker](#luke-skywalker-advanced) / [Han Solo](#han-solo-proficient) | Level 4+ | Improve the Engineering team | Involved in 3 areas | Read 10+ culture whitepapers | Contribue to the knowledge base  |
| Jedi Master | [Master Yoda](#master-yoda-sensei) / [Han Solo](#han-solo-proficient) | Level 5 | Improve the Company | Own 1, involved in 3 other areas | Contribute to the whitepapers Database | Same as previous  | 

## In more details

Here's what each of these criterias mean, in more details:

- **Ownership** is what you are involved in. It can include typical things such as Backend or Frontend, to more "out of your role" topics, such as Growth, BI, Recruitment and so on.

- **Culture backgorund** is to ensure that every Engineer at Bunch has knowledge on the science we use to build our product. We are not working on a simple Domain, and understanding it will make every engineer at Bunch more impactful.

- **Customer-orientation** (one of the dimensions of the O'Reilly model) is the main focus of Bunch. We want everyone in the team to know and feel what our customers need in order to delight them.

- **Tech skills** are related to programming languages, and you can find a more complete description [right beneath](#tech-skills).

- **Problem solving** is one way to know how helpful your are to the whole organization, we go in further details [here](#problem-solving).

### Tech skills

For each programming language that you know, you can be:

#### R2D2 (Beginner)

- Know the standard language libraries 
- Be able to create Basic Programs/web pages/scripts 
- Know the gotcha's, common mistakes of the language
- You work mostly with GUI

#### Young Anakin (Hustler)

- HTTP requests: how to make them and process them
- Data Types & Structures: primitives, classes, arrays/lists, maps/hashtables/dictionaries
- 3rd party libraries/tools knowledge, related to what you work mostly with (eg: pandas, numpy, scikit, lodash, mongoose, SQLAlchemy, ramda, etc.) 
- Basic knowledge on scripting (if you see a script, you can understand what it does)

#### Han Solo (Proficient)

- Fully Autonomous on 1 framework 
- Unit testing with at least framework 
- OWASP top 10 & Ethical Hacking 101 theory 
- REST APIs principles
- You use CLI tools to optimize your dev environment 

#### Luke Skywalker (Advanced)

- Autonomous on 2 frameworks or more
- Unit testing with 2 different frameworks
- You know how to write integration tests

### Problem Solving

The definition of problem solving comes from this great [blog post](https://be.helpful.com/how-to-be-an-effective-early-stage-employee-hint-be-helpful-e681b456a01f) from Daniel Debow. It presents a pyramid of how can you be most helpful in your ownership areas. I summarized his article below for conciseness, however I would recommend you to have a read, the examples he shares are very insightful.

- **Level 1**: you tell your boss ‚Äúthere is a problem‚Äù
- **Level 2**: you tell your boss you‚Äôve found a problem and investigated some causes 
- **Level 3**: you say to your boss, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the problem, here are some possible causes, and here are some possible solutions.‚Äù 
- **Level 4**: ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the problem, here‚Äôs what I think caused it, here are some possible solutions, and here‚Äôs the solution I think we should pick.‚Äù 
- **Level 5**: this is where you say to your boss, ‚ÄúI identified a problem, figured out what caused it, researched how to fix it, and I fixed it. Just wanted to keep you in the loop.‚Äù
